PCLanTransfer
=============

## About

PCLanTransfer is a small program that enables users to quickly share files and folders across a LAN. 
It supports multiconnections and allows for multiple downloads from different sources. 
The program also logs the progress of all transfers, so that in the event of a connection failure or shutdown of any machine, the program will resume from the most recent transaction.
The program can work on any operating system that can run the latest version of Python, and files can be shared across many types of machines with different types of operating systems.
